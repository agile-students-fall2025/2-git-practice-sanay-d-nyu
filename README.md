#### Why I find this interesting

As someone learning (and searching for a job) in software development, it is sometimes difficult to feel hope with all the news about LLM's constantly
getting better and better at writing code. This article, however, shows a glaring error that an AI agent made which, if made by a developer, would **immediately**
get them fired or at least put on a PIP of sorts. This kind of mistake gives me some hope that there is still demand for actual, human developers. While yes, LLM's
and agents are cool, very useful tools, the finesse and critical thinking that comes from a well developed programmer's brain can't be matched. I love this article 
because it shows that there is, and always will be, a need for human developers.
